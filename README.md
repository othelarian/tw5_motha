# Motha, a theme plugin for TiddlyWiki 5

This repository is where the [Motha theme](https://othelarian.github.io/tw5_motha/) for [TiddlyWiki 5](https://tiddlywiki.com) reside. Fill free to read the code, fork, modify, PR, etc.

## Install Motha theme

The best way to install and use this theme is to read the doc on the [gh-page](https://othelarian.github.io/tw5_motha/).

## Serve and build

To serve the wiki server, a good idea is [to start with the doc](https://tiddlywiki.com/#Installing%20TiddlyWiki%20on%20Node.js).

There is no script to build, for now the idea is to run `tiddlywiki motha --build index` and then run `mv motha/output/index.html docs/`.

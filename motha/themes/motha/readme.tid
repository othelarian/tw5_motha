This [[TW5|https://tiddlywiki.com/]] theme is inspired by [[Moments by Riz|https://ibnishak.github.io/Tesseract/themes/moments.html]]. I wrote it from scratch, to learn how to hack [[TW5|https://tiddlywiki.com]] and have a great theme, so it isn't a copy-paste, but a real rewrite. Please read the node below, and feel free to share your thoughts about it, or even [[hack it back|https://github.com/othelarian/tw5_motha]]! Look at the TW5 discord, you'll find me there.

See [[Github page|https://othelarian.github.io/tw5_motha/]] or [[the repo|https://github.com/othelarian/tw5_motha]] for more information.
